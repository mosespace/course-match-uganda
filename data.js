It is a 3-year program that looks at the different factors affecting our daily lives as tech-generations.\nDevelopments of new technologies are emerging into digital spheres of interaction between humans and machines/technology. At one end, humans are compromising some of their rights such as privacy, and also exposing themselves to e-criminals, where at the other end technologies are serving the purpose of human needs satisfaction. Many people are misusing technology advancements and thus hurting intentionally or not, other users. Many crimes have been conducted against cyber users and the advent of Artificial Intelligence is radically altering the digital landscape.\nBCFCI, a remarkable discipline has been developed to increase capacity of investigators to tackle computer crimes issues in Uganda and globally."

Biomedical engineers are proficient scientists who use the principles of engineering and life sciences and conduct research on the biological aspects of human and animal life. They may be called upon in a wide range of capacities to design instruments, devices and software, to bring together knowledge from many technical sources to develop new procedures, or to conduct research needed to solve clinical problems. Specialists in this field are concerned with developing imaging systems such as magnetic resonance, ultrasound and x-ray machines, techniques and devices to automate or control body functions."
